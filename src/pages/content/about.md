  WHAT WE DO


  As the premier conveners of events and opportunities for young African
  professionals in the diaspora, our mission is to connect young African
  diaspora professionals to career development and opportunity creation. We
  fulfill this mission providing timely and relevant resources, facilitating
  innovative professional development experiences, fostering inspirational
  networking, and encouraging impactful community building. These goals advance
  our vision to address the professional needs of young Africans in the
  diaspora; support more Africans in positions of power and influence; and
  positively influence narratives about the continent.

  workplace, our curated workshops and networking events provide special access
  to unique professional development opportunities, help you launch
  entrepreneurial aspirations and advance in your career.


  Foster Networking and Encourage Community Building

  people with similar interests, and build communities of support and

  WHO WE ARE


  YAP DC has always been operated by dedicated and highly skilled volunteers.
  The public and our members are our clients, and we treat them as such. In late
  2018, we stood up a Board of Directors and re-structured our Operations Team
  to maintain YAP DC’s 501(c)(3) status and manage operational transitions from
  year to year. The Board is the highest governing body of the organization,
  responsible for establishing the vision, mission and overall direction of the
  organization. Let’s meet the team.
